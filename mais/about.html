	<p> Happy Christmas baby!!! This is (basically) our third Christmas together and although we’ve never actually spent the day together I’m still so happy to be with the most perfect girl on this festive day! I love you very very much <3 p.s. Told you I’d make you something :P</p>

	<h3>Now, what is this?</h3>
	<p>This is my present to you. I know how much you love looking over all of our old messages and seeing how much we’ve changed over the years (aka trying to track down the exact moment when the magic died). Now although you can browse our Facebook messages you’ve lost a key part of our relationship time capsule, that being our first ever text messages! And that is my gift to you this Christmas!  </p>

	<h3> How does it work? </h3>

	<p>So, how does this thing work? Now there should be a button somewhere on this screen (idk if I’ve programmed it yet) which will take you to the main page! On this page you can see a snapshot of our chats over our first couple of years at uni. The way it works is, my magical program chooses one day out of all of our chat history and shows it in a lil imessage format. You only get one day of texts per day (so no trying to spam refresh to see them all in one day please). Each day that you come back to this website there will be a new batch of messages for you to look at!  </p>

	<h3> Fun Facts </h3>
	<ul>
		<li> We've got 456 days of total text history! (2016-09-18 - 2018-04-27)</li>
		<li> The first day we texted eachother we sent a total of 99 messages to eachother!</li>
		<li> In those 456 days we sent 23600 messages!! How fricken crazy is that!! </li>
	</ul>
