                    <p>During the past 30 years the modern telephone system has evolved from a basic call handling system designed for the making, taking and transferring of telephone calls, into a platform capable of hosting a range of advanced applications designed to maximize communication efficiency.</p>

                    <p>The latest 'IP' based systems are introducing further 'convergence' of voice and data technologies, i.e. the integration of voice, data, web and video. In addition, the Total Cost of Ownership is reducing further still as voice traffic shares the same cabling as data traffic, and the battle by the 'carriers' to increase their market share will bring yet more reductions in the cost of network calls.</p>
                            
                    <p> Danixa Ltd is a national and international supplier, installer and maintainer of Voice over IP (VoIP) business telephone systems, network provision (calls and lines), fibre optic. We specialise in some of the most advanced and versatile products on the market. The company has enjoyed sustained organic growth each year since its formation. Strategic acquisitions have transformed the profile of the company from a regional organisation to a multinational enterprise with its customer base stretching the length and breadth of the country and overseas.</p>
                            
                    <p>Due to Danixa’s expertise and experience in this field it is regularly instructed by some of the market leading telecommunications companies to provide solutions to their clients.</p>
                           
                    <p>Whatever the size or type of your business Danixa can provide you with a seamless end to end fully integrated Telephony solution tailored to fulfil your specific requirements.</p>

                    <p>With very few exceptions organisations rely heavily on the infrastructure their voice and data reside on. Danixa provide a fully supported end to end installation service from survey to design, implementation and testing for Ethernet and fibre infrastructures.

                    <h2><span><i class="fa fa-wifi"></i></span>Wireless Backhaul</h2>
                    <p>f your organization resides in multiple locations connecting voice and data over the public domain can be expensive and in some cases limited. There are now a number of ways your business can stay connected without incurring annual costs associated with such services.</p>  

                    <p>DANIXA will survey your locations using the latest software and hardware to determine the best solution to install or replace your existing products with from our portfolio. Options include point-to-point and point-to-multi-point variants depending on your organizations requirements. </p> 

                    <p>We only use commercial grade products from manufacturers we partner with such as Motorola, Cambium, Proxim, BridgeWave and Terabeam. The technologies employed are either wireless or FSO (free space optics) or for resilience a mixture of both. </p> 

                    <p>In most instances the deployment of a wireless solution reduces the necessity to have a true line of sight which offers greater benefits when used in metropolitan or geographically congested areas. Wireless offers link speeds of up to 1 GB per second full duplex with an average latency below 3 milliseconds as opposed to FSO which requires a direct line of sight. FSO throughputs are usually greater than wireless with link speeds of up to 10 GB per second and an average latency of around 1 millisecond. Both wireless and FSO provide higher levels of security making them even more secure than those used within the public domain. In most cases the ROI (return on investment) can be in as little as six months in relation to a lesser leased line service.</p>

                    <p>Access control and CCTV are business security systems that control and monitor entry into or within buildings.</p>   

                    <p>Today’s multi-site business security systems have changed the way security, property and even HR managers look at access control systems and CCTV. </p>

                    <h2><span><i class="fa fa-video"></i></span>CCTV</h2>
                    <p>Danixa work with some of the most innovative manufacturers of surveillance products in the world. Depending on your requirements Danixa will tailor a solution to fit your needs, from a single covert camera to a multi-site access control integrated intelligent networked system. Because we also design and implement our own voice and data networks, it means that your systems will be a truly integrated solution.</p>

                    <p>CCTV plays a large part in today’s commercial arena, it has evolved from being a deterrent against criminal activities to an invaluable management tool.  Many businesses utilize the benefits of surveillance to monitor operations within their business ensuring correct practices are adhered to.  The ability to have eyes and ears in certain areas has reduced the requirement for additional staff and enhanced awareness, allowing the monitoring of productivity and safer working environments where possible hazards may arise.  With the availability of mix and match technologies and the ability to intelligently interpret the digitized images in real-time, surveillance can now be used to interact with external applications such as number plate recognition for use in automation of car park barriers, billing and much more.  With the use of high definition camera’s and facial recognition biometric software, greater administration of individuals can also now be achieved.</p>

                    <p>Connectivity and storage have also taken a leap forward, with IP integrated systems; camera’s that where at one time limited by the length of wire back to the server, can now be network based.  With today’s fast public networks and optimized private networks, surveillance can even be distributed worldwide, the video streaming stored, managed centrally and viewed in real-time from mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones.  When used in conjunction with one of Danixa’s commercial grade wireless infrastructures, cameras can be used in places previously not possible.  Images stored in a digital format are more versatile to access simplifying sharing, copying and backing-up in mission critical environments.</p>

                    <p>Danixa maintain many types of access control and CCTV systems.  Companies simply wanting to switch maintenance suppliers for budgetary reasons or to improve service levels, can rely on Danixa for cost effective proposals and unparalleled customer service.</p>

                    <p>In addition to the standard access control solutions we provide, we can enhance them with biometric technologies. Unlike conventional access controllers which use either manual input methods such as keypads or proximity methods of inputs such as RFID (radio frequency identity) cards, biometric devices use the unique features of an individual, such as fingerprints, retinal scans and facial recognition weigh-points to process algorithms which compare characteristics stored within a database.</p>

                    <p>Biometric readers can be used soley or in conjunction with conventional keypads or RFID readers as an additional layer of authentication.  When a dual method of authentication is employed, levels of security are enhanced many times that of a single method of authentication.  Our biometric solutions track both authenticated and non-authenticated attempts for access. Interrogation of the database will identify both authenticated and non-authenticated attempts for access displaying the captured image, timestamp and action taken to allow or restrict entry.</p>

                    <p>A crucial part to most businesses are their communication platforms and the devices that store the data. Safeguarding power supplies to these types of equipment can be done with the implementation of a UPS (uninterruptible power supply).</p>

                    <p>UPS’s have several functions, primarily to ensure the Power Supply to the equipment is clean and surge free from the national grid and also to allow a grace period for the equipment to continue running allowing shut down in a controlled manner following a mains power failure. Depending on your requirements Danixa can supply a standalone UPS capable of supporting a single machine through to a full size generator capable of supporting an office block.</p>
